**In mathematics, an integral is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations. Integration, the process of computing an integral.**

> Newton Leibniz Theorem    

**Let F(x) be a function such that f(x) is its derivative. Then** \begin{equation}
\int_a^b f(x) d x=F(b)-F(a)
\end{equation}
